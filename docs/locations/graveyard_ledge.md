# Graveyard Ledge

### You will need:

- The boots
- A sword, typically; it's not impossible to perform this clip without one, but logic won't require you to
- Access to [Lower West Light Death Mountain](../regions/light_west_dm_lower.md)

### You want to:

1. Head to lower west light Death Mountain, and **walk to the lower right corner**
2. Get into the [spindash](some_link) state
3. From the lower right corner of the screen, **walk down/left** until just before you would clip into the corner to the left
4. Hop down by continuing to hold down/left, but as you are in the middle of hopping down, **hold up/right** until after you've landed
  * It's **imperative** that you hold up/right during the hop animation. If you fail to do so, you'll likely end up softlocked in the middle of the cliff
5. **Let go** of up/right
6. **Tap right**
7. **Walk down** to move screens to the south
8. You should be on the cliff above graveyard ledge. **Walk to the right** so that you're above the door.
9. **Walk down** and hop down in front of the door.
