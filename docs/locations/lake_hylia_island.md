# Lake Hylia Island

### You have:

- The boots

### You want to:

1. From Link's house, **walk east** one screen.
2. Clip into the corner at the bottom-left of this screen. This will be a [Downwards Teleport](../tech/downwards_teleport.md) on the lower of the two available spots.
3. After the initial teleport, continue **holding down/left** until link hops down. Let go of down/left while he's hopping down. You should just barely be able to see the top of Link's head.
4. **Walk right** until you can't move right anymore.
5. **Walk down** to the next screen.
6. Link will automatically walk down until he stops at Lake Hylia Island. While he's doing this, **keep holding down**. Link will hop, splash, then hop again and land on the island.
