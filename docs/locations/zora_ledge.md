# Zora Ledge

### You will need:

- The boots

### You want to:

1. **Store a [waterwalk](../tech/waterwalk.md)**. This waterwalk will be carried through the whirlpool on the southern bank of Lake Hylia, so the closest spots to store one tend to be:
  * Mini moldorm cave if approaching from the west
  * Ice rod cave if approaching from the east
2. **Fake flipper** into Lake Hylia; you can use the same fake flippering location as one would if fake flippering into Lake Hylia for NMG purposes
3. **Swim to the whirlpool** on the southern bank of Lake Hylia
4. **Swim up** to the Zora region, taking care not to take damage or exit the water.
5. **Swim all the way around** to the far east of the Zora region until you reach the waterfall south of King Zora, again taking care not to take damage or exit the water.
6. **Swim downwards off the waterfall**. Your stored waterwalk will land you safely on the water, and you can walk to the Zora ledge.
