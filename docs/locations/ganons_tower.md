# Ganon's Tower

### You have:

- The boots
- The Moon Pearl
- Access to [Lower West Light Death Mountain](../regions/light_west_dm_lower.md)
- Optionally, a hookshot to make things a little easier

### You want to:

1. **Take the portal** to the dark world immediately to the right of Spectacle Rock.
2. **Hop down** to the lowest part of lower west dark Death Mountain.
3. **Walk to the lower-left**  as far as you can go.
4. **Face down and hug the top** of this wall.
5. **Hold out your sword**
6. **Walk left**. Eventually, you will reach a corner.
7. Remaining at this same Y-coordinate, **clip left** into the corner until you can't go left any more.
8. **Let go** of your sword.
9. **Hold down/right** to leap off of the ledge. It seems a bit counter-intuitive, but it'll work - though you do have to be clipped into the corner as far left as you can go.
10. While you're in midair, **let go of down/right**.
11. cIf you did everything right, where you landed is a tiny bit left of the stairway heading into Ganon's Tower. **Tap right** to properly align yourself with the stairway.
12. **Walk up**, and you'll end up in Ganon's Tower.

### Alternatively, if you have the hookshot:

6. While holding out your sword, **perform a [hookdash](some_link_to_hookdashing)**
7. Continuing to hold out your sword, **walk left**. In the hookdash state, Link will clip into the corner simply by walking into it.
