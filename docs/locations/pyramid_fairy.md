# Pyramid Fairy

### You will need:

- The boots
- A sword
- The Moon Pearl
- The mirror
- Access to [east light death mountain](../regions/light_east_dm.md), believe it or not

### You want to:

1. Start by doing the **clip into [Tower of Hera](tower_of_hera.md)** - however, don't go in
2. Instead, when you can feel that you're on the stairs to Tower of Hera, **walk down** until you hop down an invisible ledge.
  * From here, you're navigating through what physically appears like the bottom of east death mountain, but which is functionally the top of it. In practice, right now you've just hopped down the ledge in front of Tower of Hera, and you're standing directly north of the circle of rocks surrounding the portal to the dark world
3. **Walk down** and feel your way around the top of the three rocks
4. **Walk down** and enter the portal to the dark world. If you miss the portal, you can always walk back up and try to reposition yourself against the rock
5. Once you've entered the dark world, **walk down** and feel around for the opening to the ledge that takes you to spike cave.
6. **Hop down** in front of spike cave
7. **Hop down** again
8. The actual physical location of your sprite is now in line with where it appears to be. **Continue walking down** and around the ledge
