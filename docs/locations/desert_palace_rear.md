# Desert Palace (Rear)

### You have:

- The boots

### You want to:

Start by doing the clip to get to the [Desert Ledge](desert_ledge.md)

Instead of heading immediately south, walk to the right so that you can fully see the Maze Game lady.

Keep wiggling bit by bit down and to the right until you can see most of the window to the right of the Maze Game lady. We're trying to get past the leftmost of the four rocks blocking the back of Desert Palace.

Transition to the south.

Once the screen has fully transitioned, walk up. This will hop you down behind the rocks blocking the back of Desert Palace.
