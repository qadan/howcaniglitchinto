# Floating Island

### You have:

- The boots

### You want to:

Head one screen east of Link's house.

Clip into the corner at the bottom-left of this screen.

This will be a [Downwards Teleport](../tech/downwards_teleport.md) on the lower of the two available spots.

After the initial teleport, continue holding down/left until link hops down. Let go of down/left while he's hopping down. You should just barely be able to see the top of Link's head.

Move right until you can't move right anymore. Then, screen transition down.

Link will automatically walk down until he stops at Lake Hylia Island. While he's doing this, keep holding down. Link will hop, splash, then hop again and land on the island.
