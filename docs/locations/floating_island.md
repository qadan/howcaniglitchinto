# Floating Island

### You have:

- The boots
- Access to [East Light Death Mountain](../regions/light_east_dm.md)
- Optionally, the flippers can make things a little easier/faster

### You want to:

1. Clip into the corner in upper east light Death Mountain accessible by **walking left** from the bonk rocks. This will be an [Upwards Teleport](../tech/upwards_teleport) from the only accessible bump in this corner
2. **Walk up** until Link hops down the an invisible ledge
3. Continue **walking up and around** the left-hand side of the floating island, taking care not to push into it.
4. While standing above the top-left corner of the floating island, position yourself so that you're facing down, and the left-hand side of your shadow about lines up with the left-hand edge of the visible part of the island
5. **Hop right** to hop onto the island
6. In midair, while Link is hopping right, **hold up/left**. Link will land in the water, then hop out of it and end up on the island

### Optionally, if you have the flippers:

3. **Walk to the left hand side** of the floating island, closer to the bottom corner of the left side
4. **Hop right** so that Link lands in an invisible body of water somewhere inside the floating island wall
5. **Swim alternating right and down** until Link hops onto the island
6. Continue to **hold right** so that Link lands on the island.

### To get off the floating island:

7. Clip into the lower-right corner of the floating island. This will be a [Downwards Teleport](../tech/downwards_teleport) that will let you hop off down to where the bonk rocks are.
